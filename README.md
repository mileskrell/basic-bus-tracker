# Basic Bus Tracker

### Are you tired of those other Rutgers bus tracking apps with too many unnecessary features, like support for routes other than Winter Break 1?

I made this over five days during January 2019 to get some more practice with [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) and Kotlin's [coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html).
## Features:
* Swipe to refresh!
